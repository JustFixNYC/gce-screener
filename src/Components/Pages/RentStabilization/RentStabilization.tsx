                You can find out if your apartment is rent stabilized by
                checking your lease. If your lease says you're apartment is rent
                stabilized, then it's safe to say it is! We still recommend
                requesting your rent history to be extra certain (see below),
                especially if your lease does not mention anything about rent
                stabilization.

                Request your rent history
              </div>
              <p>
                Request your rent history to help find out if your apartment is
                rent stabilized and if you're being overcharged.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If your apartment has ever been rent stabilized, youâ€™ll receive
                a document showing the rents that your landlord has registered
                since 1984.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If your apartment is not rent stabilized, you will get an email
                the day after you submit your request, saying your apartment
                doesn't have a registration on file. This means you're apartment
                has never been rent stabilized, and therefore you meet the rent
                regulation criteria for Good Cause Eviction.
