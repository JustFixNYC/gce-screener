All of the Contentful code here and the json files in /data are copied from WhoOwnsWhat and only slightly edited to remove lingui localization. In WOW we use contentful but don't connect directly - we have a command to download the pages to static json files like here.

I made only a couple small manual edits to the files here.

- I deleted the first two nodes of each data file for the title and date so that I could manually add those to the header section and preserve our standard page layout.
- I update the link from terms to privacy to be within GCE and not to WOW.
